</blockquote>
<p>I have been meaning to wait to write this article until I reached my first quarter century (25 years old) on this planet. But my own personal experience, observing multiple friends, general observation of modern men, and my never resting mind, I couldn&rsquo;t shake of this idea unless I write it down and put it out there for everyone to scrutinize and take lessons from.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-of-rich-sons">The Problem of Rich Sons</h2>
<p>Across history and many popular folk stories, that occupy general consciousness, portray the sons of successful people as bratty, obnoxious, and pushy, despite the lack of life experience that they have. The latest iteration of such archetype that comes to my attention was TV-Series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7660850/">Succession</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It portrays an elderly, wealthy media mogul named Logan Roy. Logan owned the 5<sup>th</sup> largest media conglomerate in the world. But as the story developed, he was in the brink of relinquishing all of his control of his hard-earned success in the media industry to his children. Logan found that his children was not quite fit for handover. Each of his children had their own inadequacy that Logan finds. But for the brevity of this article, we will just focus on His <em>next-in-line</em>, Kendall. Kendall was written as a proverbial Rich Son, living in his own father&rsquo;s shadow, dealing with certain emotional instability that warranted him for some rehab in the past, and inability to handle confrontation. Logan knew this and he hated it. At one point he express to his children that he would postpone the handover for more years. Expectedly, this met with protest and fight from Kendall. As Kendall felt that he was being rob of the way to prove his worth towards his father. Which had turned as the meaning of life for a lot of men across history. Even more so, sons of successful men.</p>
<h2 id="coddled-modern-childish-men">Coddled Modern &ldquo;Childish-Men&rdquo;</h2>
<p>We could expand, liberally, such idea that shackled Rich Sons towards the modern young men. Living in a life of convenience. growing up in single mother households. Away from the warmth community of relatives.</p>
<p>My personal experience, growing up in a third-world country, around different economical condition from my fellow relatives and neighbor, being coddled and kept inside the house, retardation of emotional development especially towards the opposite sex. Being kept from facing real world problems. One could argue the similarity of the coddled eastern young men is not as far removed from their western counterparts. Although the glaring difference would be that in the eastern society, is that the rest of the men outside of those economic privilege are experiencing life closer the actual difficulty of life.</p>
<h2 id="the-wild-man-and-the-archetypes-within-male-psyche">The Wild Man and The Archetypes within Male Psyche</h2>
<p>Robert Bly in his commentary on Grimm&rsquo;s Brother story &ldquo;The Iron John&rdquo; accentuate change of men throughout their lifetime. He stated the importance of ritualistic Rite of Passages that is missing among modern civilizations (NO_ITEM_DATA:RobertBly1215). and Rob Boothroyd rendition of classical book by Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette (NO_ITEM_DATA:RodBoothroyd1212) underlines the importance to consciously maturing each of the four archetypes within a male psyche. From Warrior, Magician, Lover, to Sovereign.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-from-the-other-side-of-self">Lessons from The Other Side of Self</h2>
<p>In Jungian-Psychology, one could find the concept of Shadow. Shadow is psychological part of one-self, of which reside certain attitude, actions, emotions and thoughts that are deemed to being unwanted to live a &ldquo;Civilized Life&rdquo; (NO_ITEM_DATA:RobertA.Johnson1184). Shadow represents the repressed self during the personal development years to fit into the mold of civilized person. Such &ldquo;unwanted&rdquo; attitude, actions, emotions and thoughts don&rsquo;t just simply vanish as the increase of one&rsquo;s obedience towards the societal norms and rules. As more and more one attempts to push them back, more and more it gains in strength and size. Waiting to explode within one&rsquo;s self.</p>
<p>Shadow-worship as a cry from the shadow where certain attribute is what one currently need
shadow-worship from certain successful person.</p>
